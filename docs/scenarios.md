# Application contracts

UI: ParaBank. Every positive case registers a unique fictional customer.
Never use john/demo, fixed account IDs, implicit test ordering, or real customer data.
UI cases cover registration, logout/login, required fields, password mismatch,
invalid credentials, and opening a savings account when supported by the suite.

API: the separate Demo Users API, pinned by commit in requirements-service.txt.
Authenticated requests use X-API-Key. POST/PUT require name and email.
Roles: admin/support/sales. PATCH null is rejected (422); duplicate email is 409.
Missing/invalid credentials return 401. DELETE returns 204, subsequent GET is 404.
Each API test creates unique users and removes them in cleanup where the runner
supports finally/fixture teardown. Local CI starts a fresh real service.

CI starts the official ParaBank Docker image in an isolated loopback container,
configures JDBC there, and records the resolved image digest in reports.
Local runs default to the shared public instance; PARABANK_URL overrides it.
An application outage is a failing dependency, never a skip or successful test.
Automatic test retries are disabled. Use fresh data on reruns.
Suite source is the authoritative scenario inventory; feature parity differs for
experimental TestScript and is documented in its README.
