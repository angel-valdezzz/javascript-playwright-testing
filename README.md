**Javascript + Playwright Test** - ParaBank (UI) and Demo Users API (API).

[English](README.md) � [Espa�ol](README.es.md)

Independent automation example. Each repository owns its tests, dependencies and CI.

## Setup

Python 3.12 is used by the launcher and local API. Node projects use Node 22; Java projects use JDK 21 and Maven 3.9+.

```sh
npm install
python -m pip install -r requirements-service.txt
```

## Run

```sh
python scripts/run.py --local-api -- npm test
```

For an external API, set DEMO_BASE_URL and DEMO_API_KEY and omit --local-api. PARABANK_URL overrides the public UI URL. Environment variables must be set in your shell; .env files are not loaded automatically.

UI CI uses an isolated official ParaBank Docker container with JDBC and records its image digest. It never changes settings on the public instance. Local runs use the public URL unless you override PARABANK_URL.

## Structure and reports

Tests describe business scenarios; pages/helpers encapsulate browser and HTTP interactions. scripts/run.py manages the real local API and redacts its ephemeral key from console and text reports. Native reports are retained by Actions even when tests fail.

Read [scenarios](docs/scenarios.md), [validation status](VALIDATION.md) and [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

The public ParaBank instance can fail independently of the tests. No production service or credentials are used. Do not commit credentials or enable API request traces containing authentication headers.
